# Welcome to **Mission Two** ðŸš€

## Overview

This backend project is part of an Agile development mission focused on building a set of four RESTful APIs that support key steps in the insurance purchasing process. Each API encapsulates a specific business rule and is developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure reliability, clarity, and maintainability.

### Team Collaboration

- Up to 4 developers will collaborate on this project.

- Each developer is responsible for one API and its corresponding test cases.

### Development Practices

**Agile methodology**: Daily standups, iterative development, and continuous feedback.

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementing logic to ensure correctness and confidence.

**Modular architecture**: APIs are structured for clarity and scalability, with optional routing and shared testing conventions.
